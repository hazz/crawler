We'd like you to write a simple web crawler, in whatever language you're most comfortable in. It should be limited to one domain - so when crawling gocardless.com it would crawl all pages within the gocardless.com domain, but not follow the links to our Facebook and Twitter accounts. Given a URL, it should output a site map, showing which static assets each page depends on.

Limit to one domain
i.e. match *.gocardless.com but NOT twitter.com


Input: URL
Output: site map, showing which static assets each page depends on
